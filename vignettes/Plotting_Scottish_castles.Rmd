```{r, include = T, message=F, warning=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,

)
```

```{r setup}
library(ScottishCastles)
```

The first step is to import the different files to create the map. We have 4 disctint files: one polygon shapefile defining the border of Scotland, one klm files where all castles are stored, one excel file containing visited/closed castles and one tiff raster file with the topography of Scotland. Those files have been added to internal data so they can be called directly from the pakcage 

```{r open files}
data(visits)
```
